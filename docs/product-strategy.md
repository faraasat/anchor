# Product Strategy & Monetization

## The Problem

### Context Fatigue in Modern Task Management

Modern professionals face a critical challenge: **context-switching paralysis**. Traditional reminder apps treat tasks as isolated items, ignoring the rich context of our lives—where we are, what time it is, how we feel, and what else is happening. This leads to:

- **Notification Overload**: Reminders fire regardless of context, creating noise instead of value
- **Cognitive Load**: Users must manually assess whether "now" is the right time to do something
- **Low Completion Rates**: Tasks feel disconnected from real life, leading to procrastination
- **Cross-Platform Fragmentation**: Switching devices means losing context and continuity

### The Gap in the Market

While tools like Things 3 excel at organization and Fantastical handles calendar integration beautifully, **no app combines intelligent context awareness with emotional design**. Users want:

1. **Proactive Intelligence**: "Tell me when I'm near a grocery store AND have 15 minutes free"
2. **Household Collaboration**: Shared mental load without forcing everyone into rigid productivity systems
3. **Wellness Integration**: Recognition that productivity is deeply connected to energy, rest, and balance
4. **True Cross-Platform Sync**: Not just syncing data, but syncing **state** (what's dismissed, what's snoozed, what's in progress)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI Costs**: Groq pricing is competitive; fallback to cached responses if needed
- **Location Privacy**: All processing on-device; opt-in model with clear value exchange
- **Sync Reliability**: Supabase with optimistic UI; offline-first architecture

### Market Risks
- **Things 4 Launch**: Focus on features Apple won't build (AI, Android cross-platform)
- **Apple Reminders Improvements**: Anchor's emotional design + AI creates moat
- **Subscription Fatigue**: Clear ROI ("Save 2 hours/week = $40 value at $25/hour wage")

### Execution Risks
- **Slow Growth**: Pivot to B2B (team productivity) in Year 2 if consumer growth stalls
- **Feature Creep**: Maintain "calm" core; advanced features gated behind settings
- **Churn**: Focus on habit formation (daily engagement) and sunk cost (imported data)
