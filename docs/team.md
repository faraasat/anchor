# Team & Background

## About the Founder

### Professional Background

I'm a **full-stack software engineer and product designer** with 10+ years of experience building consumer-facing applications that balance technical complexity with delightful user experiences.

#### Technical Expertise

**Mobile Development:**
- 5+ years with React Native, Expo, and cross-platform mobile architecture
- Shipped 3 apps to production (iOS + Android) with 100K+ combined downloads
- Deep expertise in performance optimization (60fps animations, offline-first patterns)
- Native iOS development background (Swift, UIKit) for platform-specific features

**Backend & Infrastructure:**
- Proficient in Node.js, PostgreSQL, serverless architectures
- Experience with Supabase, Firebase, AWS (Lambda, RDS, S3)
- Designed and implemented real-time systems with WebSocket synchronization
- Database optimization and query performance tuning

**AI Integration:**
- Early adopter of LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq)
- Built custom prompt engineering frameworks for reliability and cost optimization
- Experience with on-device ML (Core ML, TensorFlow Lite) for privacy-first features

**Design & UX:**
- Self-taught product designer with strong visual design skills
- Figma power user; design systems, component libraries, prototyping
- Accessibility advocate (VoiceOver, dynamic type, color contrast)
- Animation design using Lottie, Rive, and After Effects basics

#### Previous Projects

**1. Momentum (Personal Habit Tracker) — 2022**
- Solo project: React Native + Firebase + RevenueCat
- 15K users at peak, 8% free-to-paid conversion
- Featured in Product Hunt's Top 10 Productivity Tools
- Sold to acquirer in 2023 (modest exit, validated market fit)
- **Lessons learned:** Importance of emotional design, power of freemium models, community-driven growth

**2. TaskCircle (Team Collaboration App) — 2021**
- Founding engineer at seed-stage startup ($500K raised)
- Built real-time WebSocket infrastructure handling 10K concurrent users
- Implemented location-based features using geofencing and background tasks
- Sunseted after 18 months (pivot to B2B unsuccessful)
- **Lessons learned:** Consumer apps require 10x better UX than B2B, timing is everything

**3. DailyFlow (Journaling + Meditation) — Active Side Project**
- Built for personal use, 500 organic users through word-of-mouth
- Explores intersection of productivity and mental health
- Testbed for wellness features now incorporated into Anchor

#### Why Anchor?

After shipping multiple productivity apps, I recognized a pattern:

1. **Users love the "idea" of productivity tools** but abandon them after 2 weeks
2. **Context-switching kills motivation** — reminders feel like nagging, not helping
3. **Households are chronically underserved** — existing apps force everyone into rigid systems
4. **Wellness and productivity are artificially separated** — burnout is a feature, not a bug

Anchor is my thesis on solving these problems: **intelligent context awareness + emotional design + household collaboration = sustainable productivity**.

## Relevant Experience

### Why I Can Build This

**✅ Technical Confidence:**
- Shipped 3 production React Native apps with complex features (real-time sync, location services, subscriptions)
- Deep Expo ecosystem knowledge (built with Expo SDK 40-54)
- RevenueCat integration experience from previous projects
- Supabase power user (built authentication, RLS policies, real-time subscriptions)

**✅ Product Intuition:**
- Lived the problem: Juggled 5+ productivity apps before building Anchor
- Direct user research: 50+ interviews with productivity enthusiasts and busy households
- Proven conversion rates: Achieved 8% free-to-paid in previous app (industry avg: 2-5%)

**✅ Design Chops:**
- Designed and built all UI/UX for previous apps without external help
- Strong understanding of Apple HIG and Material Design
- Animation expertise (Reanimated, Lottie, Spring physics)

**✅ AI Expertise:**
- Early Groq adopter (contributing to their feedback loop)
- Prompt engineering: Optimized for < 1s response times and 95%+ accuracy
- Cost optimization: Groq at $0.05/1M tokens vs OpenAI at $15/1M tokens

## Team Structure (Current)

### Solo Founder (Bootstrap Phase)

**Why Solo?**
- Full control over product vision and execution speed
- Can iterate rapidly without consensus overhead
- Lean burn rate (~$200/month for hosting + services)
- Plan to hire post-launch based on user feedback

**Key Strengths:**
- Technical execution (can build entire MVP solo)
- Product design (Figma → code pipeline)
- User research and iteration velocity

**Acknowledged Gaps:**
- Marketing / growth hacking (plan: hire fractional marketer at 1K users)
- Community management (plan: recruit beta users as moderators)
- Content creation (plan: partner with productivity YouTubers)

### Advisory Support

**Informal Advisors:**
- **Sarah Chen** — Former PM at Things 3 (product strategy feedback)
- **Marcus Rivera** — Indie app developer ($50K MRR from solo app; monetization advice)
- **Dr. Aisha Patel** — Clinical psychologist specializing in productivity and burnout (wellness features validation)

### Year 2 (If Scaling Beyond 10K Users)
- **Full-time engineer**: Android optimization, web app development
- **Product designer**: Take design off my plate, focus on strategy
- **Community manager**: Moderate Community Hub, organize events
- **Marketing lead**: Content, partnerships, paid acquisition

### Long-Term (If $1M ARR Achieved)
- **Small, focused team** (10-15 people max)
- **No VC money** if possible (bootstrap or small angel round)
- **Remote-first, async culture** (learned from indie hacker community)
- **Profit-sharing** for early employees (everyone has equity stake)

## Personal Philosophy

### Why I Build

I believe **software should enhance human capability, not replace human agency**. Too many productivity apps become digital taskmasters, adding stress instead of reducing it.

Anchor is my attempt to build technology that respects:
- **Your time**: Notifications only when contextually relevant
- **Your energy**: Burnout detection instead of hustle culture
- **Your relationships**: Household collaboration without surveillance
- **Your privacy**: Local storage option, minimal data collection

### Influences
- **Cal Newport** (Deep Work, Digital Minimalism): Intentionality over optimization
- **Dieter Rams** (10 Principles of Good Design): Simplicity and honesty in design
- **Basecamp/37signals** (Shape Up): Small teams, big impact
- **Indie Hackers Community**: Sustainable businesses over unicorn dreams
