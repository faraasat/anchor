# RevenueCat Shipyard: Creator Contest

Collaborate with creators to build their app in 1 month

## ABOUT THE CHALLENGE

Shipyard: Creator Contest is about building real, monetizable apps for influencers’ and their audiences.

Rather than creating demos for judges, you’re tasked with shipping a working MVP for an influencer and their community. We’ve partnered with seven creators representing different niches, who’ve provided seven briefs about the kind of mobile app they — and their followers — are looking for.

Browse the briefs, learn about the problem each influencer’s app is hoping to solve, and get stuck into building something real for a pre-validated audience willing to try (and pay for!) your app.

Alongside our panel of judges, the influencers will pick seven winning apps. But you don’t just get cash. You gain real-world credibility, distribution through an established creator, and the opportunity to continue developing and monetizing your app beyond the hackathon.

All participants will also receive our Shipping Container 📦 a digital bundle packed with exclusive perks and offers from our partners.

## THE BRIEFS

Josh (VisualFaktory): One portfolio to track them all

Investors juggle stocks, gold, funds, fixed income, real estate, and more across multiple platforms — messy to track and hard to understand at a glance. Josh wants a single app where users can log everything, get real-time price updates where possible, set amortization/reminder alerts for non-listed products, and unlock premium risk + diversification analysis (like country/sector exposure).
